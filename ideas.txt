UI:
	MenuStr - string input
	MenuChoice - choose from options
	MenuRadio - boolean
	object that can store a reference, a better MenuNum perhaps?

	transparency - can see past or through objects with transparency
	fire

	more rock formations
	stones - donkey bridge to fighting and inventory

	moving
	inventory
	sheet
	looting
	fighting
	training dummy

Next projects are probably before gameplay:
	unicode
	temporary colors - when changing level, can forget earlier temporaries
	textbox - cousin of Menu, but always read only

	SubMenu - right click menu or expandable options


There should be a way to reuse id of previous level
